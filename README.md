# AT-related gene expression explorer
Explore Anxious Temperament (AT) associated gene expression based on RNA sequencing of mRNA from the central nucleus of the amygdala. I'm thinking about making this more general, but not sure if it's worth it. Let me know if you think it is.


This is a first attempt at creating a flask server that will help to explore the relationships between our phenotype measures and gene expression.

I wouldn't suggest thinking about this too much without talking to Drew Fox. 

A working version of this can be found online: [http://at.psychiatry.wisc.edu](http://www.at.psychiatry.wisc.edu)

This allows you to explore top hits for particular analyses, e.g. top gene expression associated with freezing at initial assessment during exposure to the no-eye-contact condition of the human intruder paradigm, [here](http://at.psychiatry.wisc.edu/top_genes/Freezing_duration_Time1?n=100&min_exprs=10&sort_col=1&threshold=.005)

as well as, explore multiple different ways of looking at the anxiety vs. expression levels relatioshp for a particular gene, e.g. [APP](http://at.psychiatry.wisc.edu/results/APP).


This is somewhere between useful data and a proof-of-principle data exploration toy. I'd love to hear any thoughts you might have.
