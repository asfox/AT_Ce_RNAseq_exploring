# AT_Ce_RNAseq_exploring
Explore Anxious Temperament (AT) associated gene expression based on RNA sequencing of mRNA from the central nucleus of the amygdala. I'm thinking about making this more general, but not sure if it's worth it. Let me know if you think it is.


This is a first attempt at creating a flask server that will help to explore the relationships between our phenotype measures and gene expression.

I wouldn't suggest thinking about this too much without talking to Drew Fox.
