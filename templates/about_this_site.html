          This website describes data that was collected as a part of a collaboration between the Kalin and Knowles labs, and was lead by Andrew Fox.

          This website compliments Fox et al., "Neurotrophin-3 signaling in the dorsal amygdala decreases anxiety and alters extended amygdala metabolism in non-human primates." In this study we sequenced the RNA from the dorsal amygdala of 46 rhesus monkeys, in an attempt to discover genes that were related to Anxious Temperament (AT). With the hopes of increasing the impact of this unique dataset, we have created this website as a data exploration tool that allows you to investigate the relationship between dorsal amygdala gene expression and our behavioral and neuroimaging measures.
